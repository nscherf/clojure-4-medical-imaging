# Documentation of clojure tools for medical imaging

## general remarks
First tool to integrate is FIJI/ImageJ. For now I couldn't get the fiji-lib from the Maven repo to work with Leiningen. However, there is already the great *funimage* clojar from Kyle Harrington [funimage](https://clojars.org/funimage). I use this to begin with.
